## DIY wipe-off tokens for Magic the Gathering

This is a very simple set of CSS styles for printing your
own wipe-off MTG tokens. These are sized to be the same as
a magic card and can be printed straight from the browser,
9 at a time. Just open the index.html file in your browser
then press print.

Once printed you can cut and laminate these. Together with
a fine-tip whiteboard marker you can represent a token
of anything in the game.

### Basic instructions

There are 2 tokens you can print. A plain token which just has
a frame or a token with a small box in the bottom corner for
putting power and toughness.

```
<!-- plain token -->
<div class="card-frame"></div>

<!-- with power and toughness -->
<div class="card-frame with-pt"></div>
```

Contributions welcome :)
