## DIY wipe-off tokens for Magic the Gathering

This is a very simple set of CSS styles for printing your
own wipe-off MTG tokens. These are sized to be the same as
a magic card and can be printed straight from the browser,
9 at a time.

Once printed you can cut and laminate these. Together with
a fine-tip whiteboard marker you can represent a token
of anything in the game.
